# The contrast-agent based perfusion lexicon (CAPLEX)  [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/498446550.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/498446550)

## Overview 

The ISMRM Open Science Initiative for Perfusion Imaging (OSIPI) aims to promote the sharing of perfusion imaging software in order to reduce duplication, improve reproducibility and speed up translation. This repository contains the github pages content for the lastest version of the contrast agent based perfusion lexicon. 

The lexicon was developed and maintained by Taskforce 4.2 of OSIPI and aims to define standadised terminology and definitions for commonly used quantities, models, and processes used in DCE-MRI and DSC-MRI analyses. 

The lexicon is hosted as a github page website (osipi.github.io/OSIPI_CAPLEX/). 

## Repository contents
The repo is in development but currently contains:

1. the backend for the CAPLEX webpage (found on gh-pages)
2. XML schema files and examples for lexicon-linked algorithmic encoding
